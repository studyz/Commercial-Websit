# Web Technologies - Assignment 2 Proposal #
Aditya Singgih & Xue Yang


### Theme ###
We are creating an E-commerce website, focusing on the sales of PC parts and accessories.
The main purpose of this project is to develop a user friendly website where users may 
put together their choice of items to the cart, and checkout as soon as possible.

### Web Server ###
For this project, Apache2 web server will be utilised. This is due to the popularity and
compatibility of this particular web server towards many general-purpose web scripting
languages, such as php and javascript for example. Apache2 is also the built in webserver
when LAMP or XAMPP stack is used.

### Choice of CMS ###
Up to this point, Wordpress is the chosen CMS for our project. Wordpress is a very popular
and user friendly CMS for web design. However, we might or might not change the choice
of CMS, depending on the full specification of the assignment.
